<h3 id="you-don't-know-jack-2015"><a class="header-link" href="#you-don't-know-jack-2015"></a>You Don&#39;t Know Jack 2015</h3>
<p>The comedy trivia sensation returns with hundreds of new questions that you can tackle on a night in by yourself or when you’re joined by friends.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>1-4 Players</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the standard format for You Don&#39;t Know Jack games, four players are tasked to answer multiple choice trivia questions presented obscurely in the game&#39;s &quot;high culture meets pop culture&quot; format. Players score points in the form of money for answering correctly and in a shorter amount of time and lose money for wrong answers. Multiplayer games also feature &quot;screws,&quot; where one player can force another player to answer immediately and can earn a bonus if the &quot;screwed&quot; player answers incorrectly. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.</p>
<h3 id="fibbage-xl"><a class="header-link" href="#fibbage-xl"></a>Fibbage XL</h3>
<p>The hilarious bluffing game now has 50% more questions added to the original hit game, Fibbage. Convince your friends that you know the answers to odd trivia questions OR aim to win the Thumbs Cup with the funniest answer.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>2-8 Players</li>
</ul>
<p>Fibbage XL expands on the original Fibbage with more potential questions. Each round of the game, a player selects from one of five random categories, and an obscure fact is presented to all players with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player uses their local device to enter a reply for those missing words; if they enter the actual right answer, they are asked to enter something different. Then, the game presents all replies, including the correct one, to the players, who then select what they think is the right answer. Players score points for selecting the right answer, but can also score if other players select their reply, so players are encouraged to provide seemingly correct answers for their replies. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds is the winner.</p>
<h3 id="drawful"><a class="header-link" href="#drawful"></a>Drawful</h3>

They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase. Following this, each picture is presented to all players, and the other players must enter a phrase they think the picture represents. Then, all those replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are presented to the players to make their vote of what they think the original phrase was. The artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>3-8 Players</li>
</ul>
<p>Earwax is played by 3-8 players. One player is selected as the judge and are given a choice of two categories. The category is presented to the other players, and these players are each given six random sound effects. Each player then selects two of the sound effects, in order, as a reply to the category.

<ul class="list">
<li>3-6 Players</li>
</ul>
<p>Bidiots is described as a spiritual successor to Drawful, playable by up to 6 people. At the start of the game, each player draws two simple pieces of art according to randomly selected categories, though these categories may be thematically related and result in similar visuals (for example, &quot;going to the beach&quot;, &quot;getting a tan&quot;, and &quot;sunburn&quot;). During the game, each player has a starting pool of in-game money which is used in an auction-style format to purchase the art. During the auction, each work is randomly assigned a secret monetary value based on the category, with those works drawn for that category having the highest value; the game will randomly send hints to players on the nature of this information. Players attempt to bid and purchase the art that matches the given category name while trying to use the auction format to goad other bidders to purchase the art they made in the wrong category. Players have &quot;screws&quot; as in You Don&#39;t Know Jack to force another player to bid, and if a player runs low on money, they can take out a predatory loan that will cost points at the end of the game. At the end of the game, the player with the most money, gained by buying low and selling high, wins.</p>

<h3 id="trivia-murder-party"><a class="header-link" href="#trivia-murder-party"></a>Trivia Murder Party</h3>
<p>A deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia-obsessed killer.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>1-8 Players</li>
<li>15 - 20min</li>
<li>Audience Supported</li>
</ul>
<p>Trivia Murder Party is played out in a lighthearted theme of a horror thriller (similar to the Saw franchise). Each round includes a multiple-choice trivia question, with players earning in-game money for being correct, and then a subsequent mini-game if any &quot;living&quot; player got the question wrong. These mini-games take place on &quot;The Killing Floor&quot;, where the loser (or multiple losers) of the mini-game are &quot;killed&quot; off and become ghosts. Ghosts still participate through the rest of the game. The mini-games range from random luck, challenges against themselves and the other players, or psychological games like a Prisoner&#39;s dilemma choice. The audience collectively plays as a ghost.</p>
<p>The game proceeds for at least 5 rounds, and no more than 10, until only one player remains alive; if more players are alive after 10 rounds, players subsequently spin the &quot;Loser Wheel&quot; which has a high chance of killing them, until only one player is left.
The last alive player then attempts to escape by moving across a set of spaces by correctly determining if two presented terms fit into a given category, moving one space for each correct answer. After the first turn, ghosts, including the audience, also begin to answer the same question, but have three terms instead of two, offering the possibility of catching up to the lead. If they surpass the leader, they possess that body, becoming the &quot;living&quot; player. Once the &quot;living&quot; player passes a final space, the game is over.</p>
<h3 id="guesspionage"><a class="header-link" href="#guesspionage"></a>Guesspionage</h3>

<li>10 - 15min</li>

</ul>
<p>Guesspionage has each player, in turn, guess what percentage of people have a certain quality or do a certain activity, such as texting while driving. If there are more than 5 audience members, they are surveyed prior to the turns to get these percentages, otherwise earlier survey results by Jackbox Games are used. Once the current player makes their guess, the other active players can consider if they are higher or lower than the actual value, including opining if they are off by more than a certain amount. Points are scored by the current player based on how close they are (providing that they are 30% or closer to the answer), and by the other players if they guessed correctly in which direction they were off.
In the final round, one question with 9 choices is given, and the players all have to pick what they think are three most popular answers, with points awarded based on the answer&#39;s popularity, the player with the most points after that wins.</p>

Then each player has a chance to enter several short sayings or slogan. Subsequently, each player is then given two or more random drawings and two or more random sayings, and selects the pair that best fits together as printed on a T-shirt. These designs are then put into a one-on-one voting battle with all other players and audience members as to determine the best-voted T-shirt design and the design that had the longest voting streak. A second round of drawing, slogan writing, pairing, and voting is performed. The winning designs from each round are then put against each other to determine the ultimate winning design. Players are able to have their designs printed to custom-print T-shirts if desired, the shirts cost $18 with free shipping in the United States.</p>

In each round one player is randomly selected to be the Faker, and all players except the Faker are given instructions that involve some type of physical action, such as raising a hand or making a face; the Faker is not given this information but instead must figure out from the other players what to do. Each player then attempts to guess who the Faker by their actions, with the round ending if the Faker is guessed correctly by all other players, or successfully escaping, after which points are awarded for if at least one player guesses the Faker correctly, everyone guesses correctly, and/or if the Faker escapes capture in each task out of the number allotted (3 for 4-6 players, 2 for 3 players). After the first round, players may select any action they like.</p>
<p>The final round is always &quot;Text You Up&quot;, where each player answers a number of open-ended questions, while the Faker is given different questions which can have overlapping answers with the questions given to the players (for example, the other players may be asked about a positive trait about themselves, while the Faker would be asked what traits they would look for in a companion.)

The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and predict which answer will win that match up. Subsequently, each match is then presented to all players and the audience. The answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins, with the percentage that it wins by tied to how many points those players that guessed that match correctly get. Subsequent match-ups use these best answers going forward. After the final matchup, the player that provided the winning reply gets an additional point bonus. The second round is a &quot;blind bracket&quot; where the players are presented with a prompt, but the brackets are based on a different, related prompt using those answers.

After the timer is done, the players and audience vote for which drawing is better, with points awarded to both players based on how many votes they received, as well as an additional bonus based on the emoji votes.

Players complete the second answer and everyone else picks the option.

Each round, one player determines an activity on the ship (such as drawing or writing a response to a question) and selects a number of the other crew to participate. The assigned human players get one prompt, but the aliens get a different one that would likely cause some confusion. The results are shown, and players have the time to determine if any response seems suspicious. In later rounds, alien players have &quot;hacks&quot; they can use to either get the correct human prompt or send the alien prompt instead to a human player. At any time before the timer runs down, a player can &quot;push the button&quot; and select the other player(s) they believe are an alien. All other players then vote if they agree or not. In order for the players to be ejected, a unanimous vote must be passed. If any player votes &quot;No&quot;, the game continues. Otherwise, the game reveals if the players were correct or incorrect, with the aliens winning if any human player is ejected.</p>
